function x = metropolis(x_0, prob)
% METROPOLIS draws a sample x from the (unnormalized) probability
% distribution prob by running a Metropolis chain from initial state x_0.
% 
%   Usage:
%       x = metropolis(x_0, prob)
%
%   Input:
%       x_0 : vector / matrix
%           Initial state of the chain
%       prob : function handle
%           (Unnormalized) probability distribution from which to sample
%         
%   Output:
%       x : vector / matrix
%           Sample from the input distribution
